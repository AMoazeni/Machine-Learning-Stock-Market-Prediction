    "This article explores a Machine Learning algorithm called Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), it's a common Deep Learning technique used for continuous data pattern recognition. Recurrent Neural Network take into account how data changes over time, it's typically used for time-series data (stock prices, sensor readings, etc). Recurrent Neural Network can also be used for video analysis and prediction which can also be modeled as a time-series dataset.\n",

    "As we try to model Machine Learning to behave like brains, weights represent long-term memory in the Temporal Lobe. Recognition of patterns and images is done by the Occipital Lobe which works similar to Convolution Neural Networks. Recurrent Neural Networks are like short-term memory which remembers recent memory and can create context similar to the Frontal Lobe. The Parietal Lobe is responsible for spacial recognition like Botlzman Machines. Recurrent Neural Networks connect neurons to themselves through time, creating a feedback loop that preserves short-term and long-term memory awareness.\n",

The lower the gradient, the harder it is to update the weights (vanishing gradient) of nodes further back in time. Especially because previous layers are used as inputs for future layers. This means old neurons are training much slower that more current neurons. It's like a domino effect.\n",
